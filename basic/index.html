    <p id="paragh-desighn"><b>Ajith Kumar</b> <i>was born on 1 May 1971.[14] His father, P. Subramaniam (died 2023[15]), was
            from a Tamil Palakkad Iyer family from Kerala[16][17][18][19] and his mother, Mohini, is a Sindhi
            from Kolkata, West Bengal.[20] Ajith was the middle son out of three brothers, one of his other
            brothers is Anil Kumar, an IIT Madras graduate-turned-entrepreneur, and the other one is Anup Kumar.[21][17]
            Ajith dropped out of Asan Memorial Senior Secondary School during his tenth grade, before he had completed
            his higher
            secondary schooling.[22] Through a family friend who worked with the Enfield company, Ajith was able to get
            a job as
            an apprentice and spent six months training to be a mechanic.[23] He later quit the role at the insistence
            of his father,
            who wanted Ajith to have a white-collar job, and joined another family friend's garment exporting company as
            an apprentice.
            He eventually progressed to become a business developer and regularly travelled throughout the country on
            sales assignments</i>, improving his English-speaking skills.[23] After resigning from the role, Ajith set
        up a textiles business distributing fabric alongside three other partners. The business venture underperformed
        prompting Ajith to take up another job in the garments industry.[23] During the period, Ajith also began working
        on modelling assignments alongside his work. He was notably scouted by P. C. Sreeram during the making of a
        commercial for Hercules Cycle and Motor Company, who felt he had the appearance to become an actor.[23][24]

        Acting career
    <p>
    <pre>1990–1998
Ajith began his acting career through a one-scene appearance as a school child in En Veedu En Kanavar (1990). Through the recommendation of S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, whose son, S. P. Charan, was a classmate of his, he was cast in his first lead role in the Telugu romantic drama Prema Pusthakam (1993), which remains his only Telugu film to date. However, the shoot of the film was stalled soon after production began, following the death of the film's director, Gollapudi Srinivas.[25] As a result, his first major theatrical release was the Tamil romantic drama Amaravathi (1993), which Ajith had signed after being recommended to director Selva by Balasubrahmanyam, who had seen parts of Prema Pusthakam prior to its delay.[26] As the film went into post-production, Ajith was bed-ridden due to a racing injury while training for an amateur motor race. He underwent three major surgeries resulting in bed rest for one and a half years. As a result, his voice in the film was dubbed by actor Vikram.[22] Following the injury, Ajith was keen to make up for lost time and signed on to play supporting roles. In the following years, he played character roles in the Arvind Swami-starrer Paasamalargal (1994) and Vijay-starrer Rajavin Parvaiyile (1995). He was also seen in the family drama Pavithra (1994), which featured him as an ailing patient shown maternal affection by Radhika's character.[27][24]

Ajith's first commercially successful film as a lead actor was the romantic thriller Aasai (1995). The film, directed by Vasanth and produced by Mani Ratnam featured him in the lead role opposite Suvalakshmi, whose brother-in-law lusts for her. It performed well at the box office and established Ajith as an upcoming actor in the Tamil film industry.[28][29] Aasai also earned him his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil. He later played a college student in Kalloori Vaasal, co-starring Prashanth and Pooja Bhatt.[22] Ajith's second successful film came in the form of National Award winning Kadhal Kottai, in which Ajith reunited with Agathiyan, the director of the earlier project Vaanmathi.[30] The film paired him opposite Devayani, with Heera Rajgopal playing a supporting role.[31]
